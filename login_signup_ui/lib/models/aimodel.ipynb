      "    *   **Severity/Details:** Based on the HbA1c of 7.8% (above the normal range of 4.0-5.6%) and a fasting blood glucose of 145 mg/dL (above the normal range of 70-99 mg/dL), your diabetes is not well-controlled at this time.

      "\n",
      "*   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):** Your result is 7.8%, which is higher than the normal range of 4.0 - 5.6%. This test gives an average of your blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. A higher number means your blood sugar has been running high. According to your doctor's notes, this indicates poor glycemic control, which means your diabetes isn't as well-managed as it should be. The goal for most people with diabetes is an HbA1c below 7%.\n",
      "*   **Fasting Blood Glucose:** Your result is 145 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range of 70-99 mg/dL. This is your blood sugar level after not eating for at least 8 hours. The high number confirms that your blood sugar levels are elevated, contributing to the high HbA1c.\n",

      "*   **LDL Cholesterol (Bad Cholesterol):** Your result is 140 mg/dL, which is higher than the recommended level of less than 100 mg/dL. High LDL cholesterol contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n",
      "*   **HDL Cholesterol (Good Cholesterol):** Your result is 40 mg/dL, which is lower than the desirable level of greater than 60 mg/dL. HDL cholesterol helps remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries.\n",
      "*   **Triglycerides:** Your result is 180 mg/dL, which is higher than the recommended level of less than 150 mg/dL. High triglycerides can also contribute to heart disease.\n",
